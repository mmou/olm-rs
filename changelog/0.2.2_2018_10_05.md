# Changelog for version 0.2.2

* transition crate to Rust 2018
* remove both `OlmAccount::sign_bytes` and `OlmUtility::ed25519_verify_bytes`, as applying signing operations on arbitrary data isn't part of the Matrix protocol
* rename functions
  - `OlmAccount::sign_utf8_msg` => `OlmAccount::sign`
  - `OlmUtility::ed25519_verify_utf8_msg` => `OlmUtility::ed25519_verify`
* improve API consistency by making `OlmOutboundGroupSession::unpickle` take ownership of the supplied pickled string
* both `OlmAccount` and `OlmOutboundGroupSession` implement the `Default` trait now

## Internal changes

* simplify error handling whenever a string is returned by libolm and olm-rs attempts to convert it into a UTF-8 string
