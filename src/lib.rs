//! This is a wrapper for [`libolm`](https://git.matrix.org/git/olm/about/).
//! It exposes all original functionality, split into task oriented modules.
//!
//! This wrapper takes care of memory allocation for you, so all functions
//! in the original library exposing the buffer length of certain read/write
//! buffers (and similar functionality) are not included in this wrapper,
//! because they are used internally.
//!
//! Random number generation is also handled internally and hence there are no
//! function arguments for supplying random data.
//!
//! All errors from `libolm` that are encountered result in a panic,
//! because they are unrecoverably fatal.
//! In case a function can panic, it is annotated as such in the documentation.
//! Panics should technically never happen however.
